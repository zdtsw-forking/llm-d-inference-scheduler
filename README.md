# Inference Scheduler

This scheduler makes optimized routing decisions for inference requests to
the llm-d inference framework.

## About

This provides an "Endpoint Picker (EPP)" component to the llm-d inference
framework which schedules incoming inference requests to the platform via a
[Kubernetes] Gateway according to scheduler plugins. For more details on the
llm-d inference scheduler architecture, routing logic, and different plugins
(filters and scorers), including plugin configuration, see the [Architecture Documentation]).

### Relation to GIE (IGW)

The EPP extends the [Gateway API Inference Extension (GIE)] project,
which provides the API resources and machinery for scheduling. We add some
custom features that are specific to llm-d here, such as [P/D Disaggregation].
The two projects collaborate closely as often a feature in llm-d might require
enablement and extensions in the GIE code base.
Unique and experimental features may start in llm-d and migrate, over time, to
GIE. As a project goal, we prefer to upstream functionality to GIE when
- it has matured sufficiently and has proven wide applicability and usefulness; and
- it can be implemented in EPP alone (i.e., llm-d provides a full inference framework,
  beyond scheduling).

Note that in general features should go to the upstream [Gateway API Inference
Extension (GIE)] project _first_ if applicable. The GIE is a major dependency of
ours, and where most _general purpose_ inference features live. If you have
something that you feel is general purpose or use, it probably should go to the
GIE. If you have something that's _llm-d specific_ then it should go here. If
you're not sure whether your feature belongs here or in the GIE, feel free to
create a [discussion] or ask on [Slack].

A compatible [Gateway API] implementation is used as the Gateway. The Gateway
API implementation must utilize [Envoy] and support [ext-proc], as this is the
callback mechanism the EPP relies on to make routing decisions to model serving
workloads currently.

## Contributing

Our community meeting is bi-weekly at Wednesday 10AM PDT ([Google Meet], [Meeting Notes]).

We currently utilize the [#sig-inference-scheduler] channel in llm-d Slack workspace for communications.

For large changes please [create an issue] first describing the change so the
maintainers can do an assessment, and work on the details with you. See
[DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for details on how to work with the codebase.

Contributions are welcome!
