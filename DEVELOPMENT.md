## Running Tests

### Unit Tests

Coverage and race detection are always enabled.

```bash
make test-unit          # run all unit tests (epp + sidecar)
make test-unit-epp      # epp only
make test-unit-sidecar  # sidecar only
```

Coverage profiles are written to `coverage/` (gitignored). To generate
an HTML report and open it in a browser:

```bash
make coverage-report
open coverage/epp.html
```

### Comparing Coverage Against a Baseline

To see how your changes affect coverage relative to `main`:

```bash
make test-unit          # run tests on your branch first
make coverage-compare   # builds a baseline from main in a temp worktree, then diffs
```

To compare against a different ref:

```bash
make coverage-compare BASE_REF=release-0.5
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
make test-integration   # coverage and race detection always enabled
```

### Filtered Tests

```bash
make test-filter PATTERN=TestName           # epp tests matching pattern
make test-filter PATTERN=TestName TYPE=sidecar
```

### End-to-End Tests

```bash
make test-e2e
```

This creates a temporary Kind cluster named `e2e-tests`, runs the full test suite against it, and deletes the cluster on completion.

**Keeping the cluster on failure**

Set `E2E_KEEP_CLUSTER_ON_FAILURE=true` to preserve the cluster (and, when using a real cluster, all created Kubernetes objects) when any test fails. This is useful for inspecting pod logs, events, or cluster state after a failure.

```bash
E2E_KEEP_CLUSTER_ON_FAILURE=true make test-e2e
```

When set, a successful run still cleans up normally — the cluster is only kept if there is at least one test failure.

**Accessing the cluster after a failure**

E2E tests do not update the host's kubeconfig to point at the `e2e-tests` Kind cluster. After a preserved failure, export the kubeconfig manually:

```bash
# Merge into the default kubeconfig ($HOME/.kube/config or $KUBECONFIG)
kind export kubeconfig --name e2e-tests

# Or write to a specific file
kind export kubeconfig --name e2e-tests --kubeconfig /path/to/kubeconfig
```

Then use it as normal:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-e2e-tests get pods
```

**Environment variables**

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `E2E_KEEP_CLUSTER_ON_FAILURE` | `false` | Preserve the Kind cluster (or Kubernetes objects) when the suite fails |
| `E2E_PORT` | `30080` | Host port mapped to the gateway NodePort |
| `E2E_METRICS_PORT` | `32090` | Host port mapped to the EPP metrics NodePort |
| `K8S_CONTEXT` | _(empty)_ | Use an existing cluster context instead of creating a Kind cluster |
| `NAMESPACE` | `default` | Namespace to deploy test resources into |
| `CONTAINER_RUNTIME` | `docker` | Container runtime used to load images into Kind (`docker` or `podman`) |
| `READY_TIMEOUT` | `3m` | How long to wait for resources to become ready |
| `EPP_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-scheduler:dev` | EPP image loaded into the Kind cluster |
| `VLLM_SIMULATOR_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-sim:v0.8.1` | vLLM simulator image loaded into the Kind cluster |
| `SIDECAR_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-routing-sidecar:dev` | Routing sidecar image loaded into the Kind cluster |
| `UDS_TOKENIZER_IMAGE` | `ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-uds-tokenizer:dev` | UDS tokenizer image loaded into the Kind cluster |

## Tokenization Architecture

> [!NOTE]
> **Python is NOT required**. Previous EPP versions (before v0.5.1) used embedded Python tokenizers.

The project uses **UDS (Unix Domain Socket)** tokenization. Tokenization is handled by a separate UDS tokenizer sidecar container, not by the EPP container itself. Previous embedded tokenizer approaches (daulet/tokenizers, direct Python/vLLM linking) are deprecated and no longer used.

The UDS tokenizer image is built and published by the [llm-d-kv-cache](https://github.com/llm-d/llm-d-kv-cache) repository.
Published images are available: `ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-uds-tokenizer:<tag>`

- The `:dev` tag is kept up-to-date from the kv-cache `main` branch.
- To use a specific release version, set `UDS_TOKENIZER_TAG` (or `UDS_TOKENIZER_IMAGE` for a fully custom reference):

  ```bash
  UDS_TOKENIZER_TAG=v0.7.0 make env-dev-kind
  ```

- To use a different registry, set `IMAGE_REGISTRY` (shared with all other images):

  ```bash
  IMAGE_REGISTRY=quay.io/my-org make env-dev-kind
  ```

- To build the image from source, see the kv-cache repo:
  `make image-build-uds` in `llm-d-kv-cache/`

## Kind Development Environment

The following deployment creates a [Kubernetes in Docker (KIND)] cluster with an inference scheduler using a Gateway API implementation, connected to the vLLM simulator.
To run the deployment, use the following command:

```bash
make env-dev-kind
```

This will create a `kind` cluster (or re-use an existing one) using the system's
local container runtime and deploy the development stack into the `default`
namespace.

> [!NOTE]
> You can download the image locally using `docker pull ghcr.io/llm-d/llm-d-inference-sim:latest`, and the script will load it from your local Docker registry.

There are several ways to access the gateway:

**Port forward**:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-llm-d-inference-scheduler-dev port-forward service/inference-gateway-istio 8080:80
```

**NodePort**

```bash
# Determine the k8s node address
kubectl --context kind-llm-d-inference-scheduler-dev get node -o yaml | grep address
# The service is accessible over port 80 of the worker IP address.
```

**LoadBalancer**

```bash
# Install and run cloud-provider-kind:
go install sigs.k8s.io/cloud-provider-kind@latest && cloud-provider-kind &
kubectl --context kind-llm-d-inference-scheduler-dev get service inference-gateway-istio
# Wait for the LoadBalancer External-IP to become available. The service is accessible over port 80.
```

You can now make requests matching the IP:port of one of the access mode above:

```bash
curl -s -w '\n' http://<IP:port>/v1/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"model":"TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0","prompt":"hi","max_tokens":10,"temperature":0}' | jq
```

By default the created inference gateway, can be accessed on port 30080. This can
be overridden to any free port in the range of 30000 to 32767, by running the above
command as follows:

```bash
KIND_GATEWAY_HOST_PORT=<selected-port> make env-dev-kind
```

**Where:** &lt;selected-port&gt; is the port on your local machine you want to use to
access the inference gatyeway.

### Prometheus Monitoring

To deploy Prometheus alongside the dev environment:

```bash
PROM_ENABLED=true make env-dev-kind
```

Prometheus will be accessible at `http://localhost:30090`. To use a different host port:

```bash
PROM_ENABLED=true KIND_PROM_HOST_PORT=30091 make env-dev-kind
```

> [!NOTE]
> Port mappings are baked into the Kind cluster at creation time. If you change
> `PROM_ENABLED` or `KIND_PROM_HOST_PORT`, you must recreate the cluster:
> `make clean-env-dev-kind` first.

### Grafana Dashboard

The upstream [Inference Gateway dashboard](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/blob/main/tools/dashboards/inference_gateway.json) covers EPP, inference pool, and vLLM metrics.

To use it: add a Prometheus datasource pointed at `http://localhost:30090`, then import
the JSON via **Dashboards > New > Import**. See the [Grafana installation docs](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/) for setup.

> [!NOTE]
> If you require significant customization of this environment beyond
> what the standard deployment provides, you can use the `deploy/components`
> with `kubectl kustomize` to build your own highly customized environment. You can use
> the `deploy/environments/kind` deployment as a reference for your own.

### Development Cycle

To test your changes to `llm-d-inference-scheduler` in this environment, make your changes locally
and then re-run the deployment:

```bash
make env-dev-kind
```

This will build images with your recent changes and load the new images to the
cluster. By default the image tag will be `dev`. It will also load `llm-d-inference-sim` image.

> [!NOTE]
>The built image tag can be specified via the `EPP_TAG` environment variable so it is used in the deployment. For example:

```bash
EPP_TAG=0.0.4 make env-dev-kind
```

> [!NOTE]
> By default, images are built with debug symbols stripped (`-s -w`) for smaller size.
> To build a debuggable image (e.g., for use with `dlv`), override `LDFLAGS`:
> ```bash
> LDFLAGS="" make image-build-epp
> ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you want to load a different tag of llm-d-inference-sim, you can use the environment variable `VLLM_SIMULATOR_TAG` to specify it.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are working on a MacOS with Apple Silicon, it is required to add the environment variable `GOOS=linux`.

Then do a rollout of the EPP `Deployment` so that your recent changes are
reflected:

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment food-review-endpoint-picker
```

## Kubernetes Development Environment

A Kubernetes cluster can be used for development and testing.
The setup can be split in two:

- cluster-level infrastructure deployment (e.g., CRDs), and
- deployment of development environments on a per-namespace basis

This enables cluster sharing by multiple developers. In case of private/personal
clusters, the `default` namespace can be used directly.

### RBAC and Permissions

EPP is namespace-scoped. Its `Role` grants `get/watch/list` on `inferencepools`
and `pods`, plus `create` on `tokenreviews`/`subjectaccessreviews` for metrics
auth (`--metrics-endpoint-auth=true`, the default). To disable metrics auth and
avoid the cluster-scoped RBAC requirement, use `--metrics-endpoint-auth=false`.

### Setup - Infrastructure

> [!CAUTION]
> In shared cluster situations you should probably not be
> running this unless you're the cluster admin and you're _certain_
> that you should be running this, as this can be disruptive to other developers
> in the cluster.

The following will deploy all the infrastructure-level requirements (e.g. CRDs,
Operators, etc.) to support the namespace-level development environments:

Install Gateway API + GIE CRDs:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.5.1/standard-install.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/releases/latest/download/manifests.yaml
```

Install kgateway:
```bash
KGTW_VERSION=v2.0.2
helm upgrade -i --create-namespace --namespace kgateway-system --version $KGTW_VERSION kgateway-crds oci://cr.kgateway.dev/kgateway-dev/charts/kgateway-crds
helm upgrade -i --namespace kgateway-system --version $KGTW_VERSION kgateway oci://cr.kgateway.dev/kgateway-dev/charts/kgateway --set inferenceExtension.enabled=true
```

For more details, see the Gateway API inference Extension [getting started guide](https://gateway-api-inference-extension.sigs.k8s.io/guides/)

### Setup - Developer Environment

> [!NOTE]
> This setup is currently very manual in regards to container
> images for the VLLM simulator and the EPP. It is expected that you build and
> push images for both to your own private registry. In future iterations, we
> will be providing automation around this to make it simpler.

To deploy a development environment to the cluster, you'll need to explicitly
provide a namespace. This can be `default` if this is your personal cluster,
but on a shared cluster you should pick something unique. For example:

```bash
export NAMESPACE=annas-dev-environment
```

Create the namespace:

```bash
kubectl create namespace ${NAMESPACE}
```

Set the default namespace for kubectl commands

```bash
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace="${NAMESPACE}"
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using OpenShift (oc CLI), you can use the following instead: `oc project "${NAMESPACE}"`

- Set Hugging Face token variable:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN="<HF_TOKEN>"
```

Download the `llm-d-kv-cache` repository (the installation script and Helm chart to install the vLLM environment):

```bash
cd .. && git clone git@github.com:llm-d/llm-d-kv-cache.git
```

If you prefer to clone it into the `/tmp` directory, make sure to update the `VLLM_CHART_DIR` environment variable:
`export VLLM_CHART_DIR=<tmp_dir>/llm-d-kv-cache/vllm-setup-helm`

Once all this is set up, you can deploy the environment:

```bash
make env-dev-kubernetes
```

This will deploy the entire stack to whatever namespace you chose.
> [!NOTE]
> The model and images of each component can  be replaced. See [Environment Configuration](#environment-configuration) for model settings.

You can test by exposing the `inference gateway` via port-forward:

```bash
kubectl port-forward service/inference-gateway 8080:80 -n "${NAMESPACE}"
```

And making requests with `curl`:

```bash
curl -s -w '\n' http://localhost:8080/v1/completions -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0","prompt":"hi","max_tokens":10,"temperature":0}' | jq
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the response is empty or contains an error, jq may output a cryptic error. You can run the command without jq to debug raw responses.

#### Environment Configurateion

**1. Setting the EPP image registry and tag:**

You can optionally set a custom image registry and tag (otherwise, defaults will be used):

```bash
export IMAGE_REGISTRY="<YOUR_REGISTRY>"
export EPP_TAG="<YOUR_TAG>"
```

> [!NOTE]
> The full image reference will be constructed as `${EPP_IMAGE}`, where `EPP_IMAGE` defaults to `${IMAGE_REGISTRY}/llm-d-inference-scheduler:{EPP_TAG}`. For example, with `IMAGE_REGISTRY=quay.io/<my-id>` and `EPP_TAG=v1.0.0`, the final image will be `quay.io/<my-id>/llm-d-inference-scheduler:v1.0.0`.

**2. Setting the vLLM replicas:**

You can optionally set the vllm replicas:

```bash
export VLLM_REPLICA_COUNT=2
```

**3. Setting the model name:**

You can replace the model name that will be used in the system.

```bash
export MODEL_NAME=mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2
```

If you need to deploy a larger model, update the vLLM-related parameters according to the model's requirements. For example:

```bash
export MODEL_NAME=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct
export PVC_SIZE=200Gi
export VLLM_MEMORY_RESOURCES=100Gi
export VLLM_GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.95
export VLLM_TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE=2
export VLLM_GPU_COUNT_PER_INSTANCE=2
```

**4. Additional environment settings:**

More environment variable settings can be found in the `scripts/kubernetes-dev-env.sh`.

#### Development Cycle

> [!Warning]
> This is a very manual process at the moment. We expect to make
> this more automated in future iterations.

Make your changes locally and commit them. Then select an image tag based on
the `git` SHA and set your private registry:

```bash
export EPP_TAG=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
export IMAGE_REGISTRY="quay.io/<my-id>"
```

Build the image and tag the image for your private registry:

```bash
make image-build
```

and push it:

```bash
make image-push
```

You can now re-deploy the environment with your changes (don't forget all of
the required environment variables):

```bash
make env-dev-kubernetes
```

And test the changes.

### Cleanup Environment

To clean up the development environment and remove all deployed resources in your namespace, run:

```bash
make clean-env-dev-kubernetes
```

If you also want to remove the namespace entirely, run:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace ${NAMESPACE}
```

To uninstall the infra-stracture development:
Uninstal GIE CRDs:

```bash
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api-inference-extension/releases/latest/download/manifests.yaml --ignore-not-found
```

Uninstall kgateway:

```bash
helm uninstall kgateway -n kgateway-system
helm uninstall kgateway-crds -n kgateway-system
```
