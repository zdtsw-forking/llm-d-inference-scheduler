# HTTP Data Source

The HTTP Data Source is a base implementation for data layer sources that retrieve data via HTTP/HTTPS. It is designed to be embedded or used by specific data source plugins to handle the mechanics of HTTP polling and parsing. 

## Features

-   Supports both `http` and `https` schemes.
-   Configurable TLS certificate verification (skip verification).
-   Pluggable response parsers.
-   Directly polls endpoints based on their addressable metadata.

## Usage in Other Plugins

The `metrics-data-source` uses `HTTPDataSource` as its underlying implementation, providing it with a Prometheus-specific parser.
